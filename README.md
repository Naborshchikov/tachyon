<h2> <p> Features of matter to optimize thermonuclear fusion and understand the possibilities of time travel and rejuvenation. Part one. </p>
Description: </h2>
<p> The part of the algorithm at Python3 for demonstrations of the space-time structure of matter by the example of protons, neutrons, and computed tachyons. </p>
<p> The resulting structures for protons will reduce the temperature required for thermonuclear fusion. </p>
<p> The refined structures for protons and neutrons allow us to conclude that: a proton and a neutron of the same type move along the time axis and have a clockwise spin; a proton and a neutron of the second type move in the opposite direction along the time axis and have counterclockwise spin. </p>
<p> The project has produced two types of neutrons with different characteristics. This explains why the "bottle" and "beam" methods for estimating the neutron lifetime give scientists different results. This can also be viewed as proof of the obtained results. </p>
<p>Protons, neutrons consist of three segments located in the future, present, and past time. This suggests the possibility of time travel. </p>
<p> The presence of a tachyon suggests the presence of an antitachyon, which in turn will allow beginning the study of rejuvenation. </p>
<p> <h3> Project implemented in python ver. 3.7.6, with using anaconda 2020 02. </h3> <br>
To implement the project used: <br>
1. The libraries: pandas; numpy; matplotlib; scipy; prettytable; collections; csv; warnings. <br>
2. The data: The presented program uses data experimentally obtained by scientists from different countries and confirmed by NIST USA (Table#1). <br>
3. The author's algorithm at python3. </p>
<p><h3> The program includes 2 classes, table with the original data, and analytics section: </h3> </p>
<p> <h4> 1. Table with the original data </h4>  - Table#1. The table contains the data recommended by the US NIST and data of various groups of scientists. </p>

<p> <h4> 2. class Algorithm ()</h4>   - This is the heart of the program developed by the author. </p>

<p> <h4> 3. class Particles () </h4>   - This class forms the Data set for protons, neutrons, calculates the characteristics of the tachyon. </p>
<p> Table 2: Reserved for quarks.  Table 3: Values of electric charge, mass, volume by shells for the proton2. Table 4: Values of electric charge, mass, volume by shells for the proton. Table 5: Values of electric charge, mass, volume by shells for the neutron2. Table 6: Values of electric charge, mass, volume by shells for the neutron. Table 7: Mass, electric charge and volume of the tachyon. </p>
<p> <h4> 4. Analytics section </h4>   - The analytical section visualizes the conclusions presented in the description. </p>
<p> The histograms from the first to the third show the distribution of volume, electric charge, and mass over the shells of protons and neutrons. </p>
<p> Graphs from 4 to 15, showing the distribution by volume, electrical charge, and mass,  and it will simplify the technology of thermonuclear fusion. </p>
<p> Graphs from 16 to 27 show the distribution of volume, electric charge, the mass of protons, neutrons in the future, present, and past time. </p>
<p> Graph 28 shows the relative position of the tachyon, electron, protons, neutrons, depending on the mass and electric charge. </p>
<p> Graphs from 29 to 31 show how the time segmentation simplifies the analysis of particle characteristics.  </p>
<h2> Installation: </h2>
<p> The project does not require any special skills to install. It will work on Jupiter Notebook. If you are missing some packages, then they are easily loaded using pip. </p>
<h2> Usage:  </h2>
<p> To start the Project, it is enough to use Run. Everything will be done automatically. The program contains all the necessary comments.  </p>
<p> Therefore, if you need to use the received data in another program, you can easily find a place to insert the script.  </p>
<p> The presented data will speed up the transition to thermonuclear energy. </p>
<p> The presented results allow scientists to move on to a study of time travel and the extension of human life. </p>
